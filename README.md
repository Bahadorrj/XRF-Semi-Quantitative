# XRF Semi-Quantitative

This repo contains all the required contents for **semi-quantitative** analysis.

# What exactly is XRF Semi-Quantitative?

**X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)** is an analytical technique that uses the interaction of X-rays with a material to determine
its elemental composition. XRF is suitable for solids, liquids, and powders, and in most circumstances is
non-destructive. The term semi-quantitative expresses that this kind of analysis is approximate and not exact but it
uses mathematical logic in order to have a really good estimate.
