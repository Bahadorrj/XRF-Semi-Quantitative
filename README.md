# XRF Semi-Quantitative

This repo is a demo of a **semi-quantitative** program for **XRay** analysis. Note that without the proper database in
src/main/db path, this program doesn't do much. The database cannot be shared due to privacy.

# What exactly is XRF Semi-Quantitative?

**X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)** is an analytical technique that uses the interaction of X-rays with a material to determine
its elemental composition. XRF is suitable for solids, liquids, and powders, and in most circumstances is
non-destructive. The term semi-quantitative expresses that this kind of analysis is approximate and not exact but it
uses mathematical logic in order to have a really good estimate.
